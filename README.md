# Python Calculator

This is a simple Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program prompts the user to input two numbers and choose the desired operation to perform.

## How It Works

1. The program welcomes the user and asks them to enter two numbers.
2. It displays a menu of available operations:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
3. The user selects the desired operation by entering the corresponding number.
4. The calculator performs the operation and displays the result.
5. The program handles division by zero and invalid operations gracefully.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard library (no external libraries needed)
